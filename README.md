# Artefakt Pattern Library Tool

## Prerequisites

* [PHP 7.2+](https://php.net)
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) (PHP dependency manager)

I recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle.

## Installation

Install Artefakt by running this on a command prompt (requires [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to be available as `composer`):

```bash
composer create-project apparat/artefakt <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

Please make sure to replace `<project-name>` with the path and name of your project.
