# Artefakt Pattern Library Tool

## Prerequisites

* [PHP 7.2+](https://php.net)
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) (PHP dependency manager)

I recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle.

## Installation

Start a new Artefakt Pattern Library by running this on a command prompt (requires [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to be available as `composer`):

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist apparat/artefakt <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

Please make sure to replace `<project-name>` with the path and name of your project. If you need more control over the directories used by Artefakt, you can also create a custom `composer.json` in your installation directory:

```
mkdir <project-name>
cd <project-name>
composer init
```

Edit your `composer.json` to specify custom data directories, e.g.:

```json
{
    "name": "your/project",
    "require": {
        "apparat/artefakt": "dev-master"
    },
    "extra": {
        "apparat/artefakt": {
            "components": "cpms", // Component data directory
            "documents": "docs", // Document data directory
            "cache": "/tmp/artefakt" // Cache directory
        }
    }
}
```

Relative directory paths are resolved against the installation directory (the directory where the `composer.json` resides). Finally, install Artefakt with:

```
composer install
```
